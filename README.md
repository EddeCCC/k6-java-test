# k6 load testing  - Java example

The repository provides 
- API for load testing
- k6 mappers
- OTLP exporter
- InfluxDB
- Grafana

The application will parse a JSON configuration into a javascript 
file, which will be executed by k6. The `k6 run` command will be executed
**automatically** after Spring is initialized and the API has started.
By default, the API runs at `localhost:8080/books`.

---
## SetUp

If you canÂ´t use the `k6.exe`, you can run the application in Docker or install k6 manually.
You can find the installation instructions here: https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/

The application needs a JSON configuration to create a k6 script.
The configuration will be loaded from a fake server (by default: `localhost:8080/config`).

> Please take a look at the [documentation](docu/TestConfiguration.md) for the configuration


Furthermore, all values in [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) have to be defined. 
You can also use the default values.

- `path.config`: Location of the test configuration (relative to [resources](src/main/resources))
- `path.script`: Location where the javascript file will be created
- `path.output`: Location where the test results will be saved (as CSV)
- `path.logging`: Location where the console output of k6 will be logged
- `otel.host`: Host to run the OpenTelemetry collector on

All **created** files will be located relative to `./target/classes`.

---
### Docker

You can run the whole application with: `docker-compose up --build`

You can run all containers except the API with: `docker-compose -f docker-compose-no-api.yml up`

Generated **output** will be stored in `./docker-output`. 
You can configure all the docker containers in [docker-config](docker-config) and [env](env).

---
### OpenTelemetry

The result of the k6 test will be saved in a CSV file. Those metrics will be exported via OTLP
to an OpenTelemetry Collector after the test has finished. 
The Collector further exports those metrics to InfluxDB.

---
### InfluxDB (v2)

URL: `localhost:8086`

Default login: username > user,  password > telegraf


You can change it in the [.env](env/.env) file.
The organization, bucket and token are configured here, too.

---
### Grafana

URL: `localhost:3030`

Default login: username > admin, password > admin

You can view the test results in the dashboard: [Load_Test_Results](docker-config/grafana/my-dashboards/Load_Test_Results.json)
